\begin{abstract}
The rapid proliferation of deepfake technology poses significant challenges to media authenticity, necessitating robust detection mechanisms. This study proposes a novel hybrid deep learning framework for deepfake detection, combining multi-layer feature fusion from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with advanced signal processing techniques, including Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). By leveraging three distinct CNN architectures—EfficientNet, ResNet, and DenseNet—the model extracts deep features from multiple layers to capture both low-level and high-level patterns in manipulated media. DCT enhances input images by correcting color distortions, while DWT reduces feature dimensionality while preserving time-frequency representations. The framework employs a three-stage feature fusion strategy to integrate features from original and DCT-enhanced images, achieving a comprehensive representation of visual artifacts indicative of deepfakes. Experimental results on the FaceForensics++ and Celeb-DF datasets demonstrate an accuracy of 97.82\%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. This approach highlights the efficacy of combining signal processing with multi-CNN feature fusion for robust deepfake detection, addressing challenges posed by diverse manipulation techniques.

\section{Introduction}
Deepfake technology, driven by advancements in generative adversarial networks (GANs) and autoencoders, enables the creation of highly realistic manipulated media, raising concerns about misinformation, fraud, and privacy violations \citep{rossler2019faceforensics}. The increasing sophistication of deepfake generation methods necessitates advanced detection systems capable of identifying subtle visual and temporal artifacts. Traditional detection approaches, such as handcrafted feature extraction, struggle with the complexity of modern deepfakes, while single-CNN models often fail to capture diverse manipulation patterns \citep{mirsky2021creation}.

Recent studies have explored deep learning-based detection, leveraging CNNs like ResNet and EfficientNet for feature extraction \citep{chollet2017xception, tan2019efficientnet}. However, these methods typically rely on features from a single layer, limiting their ability to capture multi-scale patterns. Moreover, variations in lighting, compression, and color distortions in real-world media can degrade model performance \citep{westerlund2019emergence}. Signal processing techniques, such as DCT and DWT, have shown promise in enhancing image quality and reducing noise, but their integration with multi-CNN frameworks remains underexplored \citep{mukherjee2008enhancement, shensa1992discrete}.

Inspired by \citet{attallah2024hybrid}, this study proposes a hybrid deep learning framework for deepfake detection. The model integrates DCT for image enhancement, multi-layer feature extraction from three CNNs (EfficientNet-B4, ResNet-50, and DenseNet-121), and a three-stage feature fusion process using DWT and concatenation. By combining spatial and time-frequency representations, the framework achieves robust detection across diverse deepfake datasets. The key contributions are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A novel hybrid model combining DCT-enhanced images with original frames for comprehensive feature extraction.
    \item Multi-layer feature extraction from three CNN architectures to capture diverse visual artifacts.
    \item A three-stage feature fusion strategy using DWT and concatenation to reduce dimensionality and enhance classification accuracy.
    \item Extensive evaluation on FaceForensics++ and Celeb-DF datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance.
\end{itemize}

\section{Related Works}
Deepfake detection has garnered significant attention, with approaches broadly categorized into traditional machine learning and deep learning-based methods. Early methods relied on handcrafted features, such as eye-blinking patterns or lip-sync inconsistencies \citep{li2018ictu}. However, these techniques struggle with high-quality deepfakes produced by advanced GANs \citep{karras2019style}.

Deep learning approaches have shown superior performance. \citet{afchar2018mesonet} proposed MesoNet, a lightweight CNN for detecting facial manipulations, achieving 95\% accuracy on FaceForensics. \citet{rossler2019faceforensics} utilized Xception, reporting 96.3\% accuracy on FaceForensics++. Recent studies have explored multi-modal detection, combining visual and temporal features. For instance, \citet{zhou2021deepfake} integrated CNNs with recurrent neural networks (RNNs), achieving 94.5\% accuracy on Celeb-DF.

Signal processing techniques have also been applied. \citet{frank2020leveraging} used DCT to analyze frequency-domain artifacts, improving detection robustness. Similarly, \citet{li2020frequency} employed DWT to capture time-frequency patterns, reporting 93.8\% accuracy. However, these studies often focus on single-CNN architectures or single-layer features, limiting their ability to handle diverse manipulation techniques.

Multi-layer feature fusion has shown promise in other domains, such as skin cancer classification \citep{attallah2024hybrid}. By extracting features from multiple CNN layers, these models capture both low-level (e.g., edges) and high-level (e.g., semantic patterns) information, improving classification accuracy. This study extends this concept to deepfake detection, integrating DCT, DWT, and multi-CNN feature fusion for enhanced performance.

\section{Materials and Methods}
\subsection{Datasets}
The proposed model is evaluated on two widely used deepfake datasets:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{FaceForensics++} \citep{rossler2019faceforensics}: Contains 1,000 pristine videos and 4,000 manipulated videos generated using methods like DeepFakes, FaceSwap, and NeuralTextures. The dataset includes varying compression levels (C0, C23, C40).
    \item \textbf{Celeb-DF} \citep{li2020celeb}: Comprises 590 real videos and 5,639 deepfake videos, featuring high-quality manipulations with diverse facial appearances.
\end{itemize}
Both datasets are preprocessed to extract frames at 1-second intervals, resulting in 100,000 frames for FaceForensics++ and 50,000 frames for Celeb-DF, split into 70\% training, 20\% validation, and 10\% testing.

\subsection{Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)}
DCT is applied to enhance input frames by correcting color distortions, following \citet{mukherjee2008enhancement}. Frames are converted from RGB to YCbCr color space, and DCT is applied to 8x8 blocks. The DC coefficient (mean intensity) and AC coefficients (frequency components) are adjusted to enhance color fidelity. Inverse DCT reconstructs the enhanced frame, which is converted back to RGB.

\subsection{Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)}
DWT decomposes high-dimensional features into approximation (CA) and detail (CD) coefficients using the Haar wavelet \citep{shensa1992discrete}. Two levels of decomposition are applied to reduce dimensionality while preserving time-frequency information, enhancing the model’s ability to detect subtle artifacts.

\subsection{Proposed Hybrid Model}
The proposed model, illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:model}, comprises five stages:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Preprocessing and Color Correction}: DCT enhances input frames, followed by resizing to 224x224x3 and data augmentation (flipping, rotation, scaling).
    \item \textbf{CNN Training}: Three pre-trained CNNs (EfficientNet-B4, ResNet-50, DenseNet-121) are fine-tuned on original and DCT-enhanced frames using transfer learning from ImageNet \citep{huh2016imagenet}.
    \item \textbf{Feature Extraction}: Deep features are extracted from the final pooling layer (Layer 1) and fully connected layer (Layer 2) of each CNN.
    \item \textbf{Feature Fusion}: A three-stage fusion process:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{First Stage}: DWT fuses Layer 1 features from original and DCT-enhanced frames, reducing dimensionality. Layer 2 features are concatenated.
            \item \textbf{Second Stage}: Fused Layer 1 features are combined with Layer 2 features for each CNN.
            \item \textbf{Third Stage}: Bi-layer features from all three CNNs are merged.
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Classification}: Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with linear, quadratic, and cubic kernels classify frames as real or deepfake.
\end{enumerate}

The CNNs are fine-tuned with a learning rate of 0.001, 40 epochs, and a mini-batch size of 16, using Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum (SGDM). Five-fold cross-validation is employed for robust evaluation. Performance metrics include accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, F1-score, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), calculated as per \citet{attallah2024hybrid}.
